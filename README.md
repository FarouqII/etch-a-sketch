# Etch-a-Sketch Clone

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch clone built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to draw on a grid by hovering over squares, mimicking the classic Etch-a-Sketch experience.

## Features
- Interactive grid that responds to mouse events
- Adjustable grid size for different levels of precision
- Clear/reset button to start fresh

## What I Learned
This project helped me improve my understanding of core **JavaScript** concepts, including:
- **Fetching elements and modifying the DOM** dynamically  
- **Writing and applying functions** more effectively  
- **Using event listeners** to handle user interactions  

## How to Use
1. Open the project in your browser.  
2. Move your mouse over the grid to draw.  
3. Adjust the grid size or reset as needed.
